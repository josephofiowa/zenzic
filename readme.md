# Zenzic

Zenzic is a the a deprecated German term meaning "squared." It is the root of the term [zenzizenzizenzic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenzizenzizenzic), which is an obsolete term that translates to "the eighth power."

This is the term I appropriate to arbitrary analysis I do for fun because 1) the mathematical undertones of this word AND 2) you're able to append the word "zenzic" to itself, which adds an additional square to any term: any analysis can always go further. (As an added bonus, I have German roots, so that's also pretty neat.)

## In this repository...

You'll find a collection of "work in progress" early inquisitivities that do not warrant their own repo: hockey analysis, data science lessons, and miscellaneous stats questions (like what does it [look like](https://github.com/josephofiowa/zenzic/blob/master/normality_exp.py) to square the normal distribution?).

 Projects that grow make their way to an independent repository. For example, hockey analysis from here grew into [Dekegeek/BOSHAC16](https://github.com/josephofiowa/dekegeek/tree/master/boshac16), where Brian Carothers and I presented cutting edge ways to measure the effectiveness NHL defensemen.
