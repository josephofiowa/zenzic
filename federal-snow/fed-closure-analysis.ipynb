    "# Does the Federal Government Close for Forecasted Snow or the Hype for Snow? \n",
    "\n",
    "The Office of Personnel Management within the federal government has the [almighty power](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/snow-dismissal-procedures/current-status/) of declaring snow days. **Do they base this decision entirely on weather forecasts, or do they fall victim to the hype that surrounds possible snow days?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, I gathered every single snow day OPM has declared (scraper [here](https://github.com/josephofiowa/zenzic/blob/master/federal-snow/fedsnow-scraper.py)). I also used the Dark Sky API to gather historical weather forecasts -- not historical *actual* weather, but what forecast was available to OPM at the time of their decision ([script](https://darksky.net/dev/) and [data](https://github.com/josephofiowa/zenzic/blob/master/federal-snow/forecasts.csv)). Finally, I downloaded the last five years of [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US-DC&q=snow) search data for searches of \"snow\" within DC ([data](https://github.com/josephofiowa/zenzic/blob/master/federal-snow/google-trends-dc-snow.csv)).\n",
